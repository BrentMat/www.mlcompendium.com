# Data contract

A data contract is **a formal agreement between a service and a client that abstractly describes the data to be exchanged**. That is, to communicate, the client and the service do not have to share the same types, only the same data contracts. - [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-data-contracts)

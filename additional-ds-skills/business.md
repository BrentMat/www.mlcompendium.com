[Unusual Ventures](https://www.field-guide.unusual.vc/) - "A tactical field guide provides you with all of the best practices and tools founders need to solve the most challenging early-stage problems". However, I see this as a guide for DS that wants to understand what is go-to-market, product-led-growth, and other topics in that space, and need a good introduction.
